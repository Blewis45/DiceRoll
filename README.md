    This web app rolls two pair of dice and displays the sum of these results in the document. It has two buttons. One button rolls two dice once. The other button rolls two dices 1000 times. It also keeps track of each result in a array for plotting on a bar graph. From this assessment, I learned how to change a bar graph using CSS.
